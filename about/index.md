Hi there! Pleased to meet you. Take a look around and let me know if you have any questions, looking forward to working with you!

I'm a Data Scientist, with interest in Natural Language Processing. Before, I pursued three master degrees : Master of Research in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning at [Paris Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), Master of Science (French Grande Ecole Engineer's degree) in Data Science at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) and Master of Engineering in Telecommunication at [Sup'Com](http://www.supcom.mincom.tn/Fr/accueil_46_3).

During my studies, I have interned at IBM France Lab, IBM MENA, BNP Paribas and Renault. I was also selected to participate in [Huawei Seeds for the Future](https://huawei.eu/what-we-do/seeds-future) Program, where I studied Chinese in Beijing Language and Culture University and was trained in Huawei Labs. 

Previously, I have worked with academic labs on several NLP and Machine Learning projects, including credit scoring, customer satisfaction evaluation through written reviews, gender recognition from face images, credit cards usage analysis, acoustic scenes identification, fake news detection, recommender systems and TV-series themed chatbots. 

My driving motive is having a positive impact and making technology more accessible. Have a look at my resume for more information.
