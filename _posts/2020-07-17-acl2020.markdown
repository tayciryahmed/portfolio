This post discusses highlights of the main conference of the 2020 Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2020).

In addition to the insightful theme choice, ACL Program Co-Chairs introduced two additional tracks: [**Ethics and NLP** and **Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP**](https://acl2020.org/blog/the-first-call-for-papers-is-out/). Indeed, after many sessions and workshops in the previous \*CL events, the community is making it clear that responsible and ethical models are crucial as more NLP models are deployed in production and driving decisions that impact people's lives. Moreover, as research works continue to push performance boudries, interpreting and analysing models has become more relevant in order to understand the models inner mechanisms and learn about the secret ingredient that make these models as performant. 

We can also see in the graph below that the most popular tracks in ACL 2020 are (1) Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP, (2) Theme: Taking Stock of Where We've Been and Where We're Going, (3) Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics and (4) Ethics and NLP.
