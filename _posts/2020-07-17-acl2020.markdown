This post discusses highlights of the main conference of the 2020 Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2020). The conference accepted 779 papers with an acceptance rate of 22.7%, had 25 tracks along with demo sessions, virtual meetups and mentoring sessions. 

For the first time ever, this year's ACL conference has a special theme with a dedicated session and award: **Taking Stock of Where We've Been and Where We're Going**. This choice absolutely highlights the current state of the field. Indeed, the NLP research has been pushing boundries in terms of performance ([GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/)), innovative architectures (BERT & co), quick access to SOTA ([HuggingFace/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)) and model sizes ([GPT-3: 175B parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)).

In addition to the insightful theme choice, ACL Program Co-Chairs introduced two additional tracks: [**Ethics and NLP** and **Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP**](https://acl2020.org/blog/the-first-call-for-papers-is-out/). Indeed, after many sessions and workshops in the previous \*CL events, the community is making it clear that responsible and ethical models are crucial as more NLP models are deployed in production and driving decisions that impact people's lives. Moreover, as research works continue to push performance boudries, interpreting and analysing models has become more relevant in order to understand the models inner mechanisms and learn about the secret ingredient that make these models as performant. 

We can also see in the graph below that the most popular tracks in ACL 2020 are (1) Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP, (2) Theme: Taking Stock of Where We've Been and Where We're Going, (3) Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics and (4) Ethics and NLP.

Below are the topics that on which I focused this year, that were also topics of interest for many other participants (c.f. links below): 

* Robust Evaluation and Ethics
* Analysis and Interpretability

## Robust Evaluation and Ethics

* best paper, best theme paper (emily bender)
