This post discusses highlights of the main conference of the 2020 Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2020). The conference accepted 779 papers with an acceptance rate of 22.7%, had 25 tracks along with demo sessions, virtual meetups and mentoring sessions. 

For the first time ever, this year's ACL conference has a special theme with a dedicated session and award: **Taking Stock of Where We've Been and Where We're Going**. The theme surely highlights the current state of the field. Indeed, the NLP research has been pushing boundries in terms of performance ([GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/) benchmark), innovative architectures (transformer, BERT & co), quick access to SOTA (HuggingFace's [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)) and model sizes ([GPT-3:](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) 175B parameters). As put by [Clement Delangue](https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue/status/1283411618395815936), Co-Founder and CEO of HuggingFace: "NLP is going to be the most transformational tech of the decade!" But at this growth pace, the Co-Chairs deemed healthy for the research community to take a step back and reflect on the current state of the field to avoid getting stuck in suboptimal solutions and consciously chart out the roadmap for future research directions. 

In addition to the insightful theme choice, ACL Program Co-Chairs introduced 4 additional tracks including: [**Ethics and NLP** and **Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP**](https://acl2020.org/blog/the-first-call-for-papers-is-out/). Indeed, after many sessions and workshops in the previous \*CL events, the community is making it clear that responsible and ethical models are crucial as more NLP models are deployed in production and driving decisions that impact people's lives. Moreover, as research works continue to push performance boudries, interpreting and analysing models has become more relevant in order to understand the models inner mechanisms and learn about the secret ingredient that make these models as performant. 

We can also see in the graph below that the most popular tracks in ACL 2020 are (1) Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP, (2) Theme: Taking Stock of Where We've Been and Where We're Going, (3) Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics and (4) Ethics and NLP.

*Note that for readability, 3 outliers were removed with 416 (Linzen et al), 533 (Gururangan et al) and 970 (Bender and Koller) views.*

Below are the topics on which I focused this year, that were also topics of interest for many other participants (c.f. links below): 

* Theme and Robust Evaluation
* Analysis, Interpretability and Ethics

## Theme and Robust Evaluation 

To quote [Fran√ßois Chollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1122330598968705025) "Training ever bigger *transformers* on ever bigger datasets gets us closer to Strong AI -- in the same sense that building taller towers gets us closer to the moon." 

 Besides, the theme illustrates the desire of the NLP community to make sure the current trend of ML models does not lead us to neglecting linguistics aspects of natural language processing.
